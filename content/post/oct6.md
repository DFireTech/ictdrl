# Welcome Race Fans
What a great day for racing! We had four members of our league out racing and what a day it was!
The brains of our operation was out, so I used the opportunity to take some data.
I am still not entirely sure what I can glean from this info, but, I will share my insights nonetheless.

## The Numbers - WHAT DO THEY MEAN?
We started out with a reported temp of 65F at 42% humidity around 9AM, and ended around noontime with 76.8F and 28% humidity.
While I dont have a cool infra gun, the track seemed pretty good for the temps we seen today

As I get better collecting the data points and see what I am to glean from it, I will offer better insights!

With four racers the group had a total of six teams - 48 racers, 12 races. 

Without our brain, we wound up having to finagle ourselves into our finals, but thats okay.

The data I collected today was just simple winners times that comes from our endgate at the finish line - some was to the thou, some to hundreds. 

Here goes:

The data will have the heat number and each winner's time. Each pool is broken into 3 segments as our queues are 4 cars and 3 sets, 12 cars per pool. 
In the semi finals, this is in two segments, and the final is two stages.

| R4 | 12.54 | 13.28 | 13.45 |

Heat 4 Avg: 13.183


Entry Fastest Time: 11.87s*
*Not shown here is a time of 11.84s in a challenge race. This was actually the fastest time in entry heats.*
*Also not shown here is the testing of the fastest car today, posting an 11.81s time*

Normally, I would have thought that as the day went on, the times would get just a bit faster (as shown by the first three averages), but, the fourth entry heat was the second slowest of these heats. 

### Semi Finals

Heat 2 Avg: 12.561

Semi Finals Fastest Time: 11.89s
*This posting was from an unexpected car, known as "Temu Turbo", a Matchbox Altima that is a squirrely car. In a few corners, you can just tell when a time is gonna be good and the car is just locked in.*

So far, what I was gleaning was that we had a decent 12-13s race day. Very little in the way of DNF's and some great passes, but, fairly straight forward racing.

### Finals
With the day coming to a close, I was pretty excited to see what kind of data I was coming home with. 
This is set up in stages as we do an eight-race closer to send the day off

Stage 1

| Race Number | Winner's Time |
| -- | -- |
| R1 | 12.683 |
| R2 | 12.716 |
| R3 | 12.329 |
| R4 | 12.975 |

Stage 1 Avg: 12.676

Stage 2

| Race Number | Winner's Time |
| -- | -- |
| R1 | 12.958 |
| R2 | 14.023 |
| R3 | 12.184 |
| R4 | 12.425 |

Stage 2 Avg: 12.8975


After all was said and done, Our podium was set:

1st was Puck in the Pink Ugly Caddy
2nd was the White Cop Charger
3rd was the Forza Evo
4th was the 82 Supra


These big ol caddy cars are just dominant this season as of late. Previously the NASCAR's were super dominant on the track. 

Finals Average: 12.787s
Finals Fastest Time: 12.184s

## Wrap Up

From the numbers, what I have gained is:

*Well, I'm unsure yet*.

Here are a couple other points for the day:

Average time for the day: 12.858s
12.49s is the time that was most prevalent (3x)
Most cars finished above a 12.7s time frame. 

Maybe one day I can correlate weight to time data. I will probably do that *IF* I can get a track built at home.

Just call me Ryosuke Takahashi. I would love to have concrete data on what is fastest at home.

We have next week off as we go 2 weeks on and 1 off week. 

Catch you all on the flip side!
